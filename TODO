TODO (ideas) :

- As a second pass, remove partitions with no file
  (e.g. option -n with too many partitions, special
  partition #0 for option -s, ...)
- Use fts(3) instead of opendir(3)
- Make the program multithread for FS analysis
- Display progress during FS analysis ?
- Display/accept size in a human-friendly format
