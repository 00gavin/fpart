TODO (ideas) :
**************

Fpart:
- Add an option to generate compressed file lists
- Switch to ftw(3) for portability ?
- Factorize code (err(3), ...)
- Add an option to specify that a directory matching a path or a pattern should
  not be split but treated as a file entry
- Add constraints, e.g. : force hardlinks to belong to the same partition
- Make the program multithreaded for FS analysis
- Display/accept size in a human-friendly format
- Add timestamps before/after hooks
- Improve sort by using, e.g. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting
- Display total size in final status
- As a second pass, remove partitions with no file (e.g. option -n with too many
  partitions, special partition #0 for option -s, ...)

Autotools:
- Use config.h (for program version, data types, header inclusion,
  build options info [...])
- Add -Wall to CFLAGS when possible (gcc, clang)

Fpsync:
- Add an option to exit after fpart pass (to generate jobs only)
- Check if src_dir/ is the same on all workers (using a stat fingerprint)
  and use the same method for dst_dir/ (stop using a witness file)
