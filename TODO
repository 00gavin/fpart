TODO (ideas) :
**************

- Add option to exclude files or dirs by name
- Add option to work with leaf directories only (not files)
- Sync fts(3) code with upstream FreeBSD version
- Add option to allow file-split for option -s ; file would then have to
  be split using a meta-file generated by that option and a helper script
- Improve sort by using, e.g. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting
- Display total size in final status
- As a second pass, remove partitions with no file (e.g. option -n with too many
  partitions, special partition #0 for option -s, ...)
- Make the program multithreaded for FS analysis
- Display/accept size in a human-friendly format
