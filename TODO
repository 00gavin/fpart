TODO (ideas) :
**************

- As a second pass, remove partitions with no file
  (e.g. special partition #0 for option -s)
- Read on stdin even if option -i is not specified
  (when not path is given as an argument)
- Use fts(3) instead of opendir(3)
- Make the program multithread for FS analysis
- Add an option to follow symlinks
- Add an option not to follow mounts
- Display progress during FS analysis ?
- Display/accept size in a human-friendly format
