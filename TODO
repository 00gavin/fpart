TODO (ideas) :
**************

- Display total size in status ?
- As a second pass, remove partitions with no file (e.g. option -n with too many
  partitions, special partition #0 for option -s, ...) ?
- Make the program multithread for FS analysis ?
- Display progress during FS analysis ?
- Display/accept size in a human-friendly format ?
- Add loading/rounding options :
  - Pre-load partitions with n bytes
  - Over-load each file size with n bytes
  - Round-up each file size to a multiple of n bytes
