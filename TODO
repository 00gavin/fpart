TODO (ideas) :
**************

- Being able to initialize file entries from arbitrary values (e.g. the output
  of 'du')
- As a second pass, remove partitions with no file (e.g. option -n with too many
  partitions, special partition #0 for option -s, ...)
- Make the program multithread for FS analysis
- Display progress during FS analysis ?
- Display/accept size in a human-friendly format
