TODO (ideas) :
**************

- Use autotools or a similar tool
- Option -D could theoretically be improved by skipping analysis and immediately
  adding current directory as soon as something other than a directory is found
  (and no directory has been found within). This would avoid visiting every
  files of the directory while we already know it has to be added (and a second
  visit scheduled to compute its size). This improvement implies finding
  a way to have fts(3) immediately skip a directory *currently* being visited.
- Improve sort by using, e.g. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting
- Display total size in final status
- As a second pass, remove partitions with no file (e.g. option -n with too many
  partitions, special partition #0 for option -s, ...)
- Make the program multithreaded for FS analysis
- Display/accept size in a human-friendly format
